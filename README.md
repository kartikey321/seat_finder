### This is a seat finder App which assists users in identifying the location and type of berth based on a given seat number

## How does it work ? ğŸ¥‚
I have used provider state management in this app to mantain the value of searched seat among different statefull widgets in the app.
The type of seats in the ui depends upon the seat number  

When user searches in the searchbox , listview scrolls down to the widget where the seat number is present and the seat is highlighted. 
If the user scrolls down/up manually so that it hides the required seat row, a floating rectangular button pops up which again scrolls to the seached seat widget
Other than this, the app goes into a searching state, in which user cannot select any other seats until clear is pressed.

## This is how it looks ğŸ’«
